    <p>"We remember starting out as just friends who had no idea what to do for a living.</p>
    <p>All we knew how to do was 'game' for all hours of the day.</p>
    <p>After spending some time with Scuf Gaming as interns, we had some ideas on what to do.</p>
    <p>With some help from our supervisors and family, we officially started up a small company.</p>
    <p>Since then, Gamer's Delight was born, and here, all gamers are family!"</p>

  <div id="second_team_message"><br>
    <p>Warzone is the latest addition to the Battle Royale craze, based on the latest<br> 
      Call of Duty title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. With this release,<br>
      they are keeping the cross platform intact allowing anyone from PlayStation<br>
       or Xbox to compete against one another. Keeping the Call of Duty competitive community as one,<br>
        instead of splitting them up. This allows for our Modern Warfare and Warzone tournaments<br> 
        to be larger as we can bring all consoles together under one platform.<br> 
        Checkmate Gaming hosts the most competitive online cash prize tournaments around,<br> 
        and we will continue with the addition of Warzone. With Warzone’s release,<br> 
        we will bring support to it just as we have done with other titles.<br> 
        With each Warzone tournament, we offer the largest payouts,<br> 
        best support and the best platform to play on..</p>
    <p>Small hour shifts, but had its perks of being able to test cool products.</p>
    <p>We slowly went up the ranks, and now here we are. An experience it was, indeed!</p>
    <p>Here at Gamer's Delight, we are productive, but also provide a fun environment for all gamers!</p>

    <p>Hello, PUBG Esports fans!

      PUBG CONTINENTAL SERIES 7 is just about to begin!<br> 
      
      As the finest teams from all around the world prepare for the battle at PCS7,<br> 
      we’d like to provide a bit more detailed information about our biggest tournament of the year, PGC 2022.</p>
    <p>One after another, web developers from all over came together to form the team we know now.</p>
    <p>We all came from a background with no knowledge of how to make a website.</p>
    <p>After we spent some time in coding bootcamps, we were instantly hired. You can say it definitely paid off!"</p>
